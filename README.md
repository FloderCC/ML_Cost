# ML Cost Framework (on develop)

## Dataset Features:
#### Before codifying the dataset:
- Class Imbalance Ratio
- Gini Impurity
- Entropy
- Number of samples
- Number of features
- Completeness (Percentage of missing values)
- Consistency (quantity of non contradictions within the data)
- Uniqueness (percentage of duplicate records)

#### After codifying the dataset:
- Redundancy (avg and std of the values in the correlation matrix)
- Maximum - minimum feature's value
- Global avg and std of the input features
- Avg and std of features' avg and std (for considering the Coefficient of Variation on the features)
